{"id":"ml_basics_01","course":"Machine Learning","topic_tags":["supervised","unsupervised","reinforcement"],"transcript":"Machine learning is about learning patterns from data rather than explicit rules. In supervised learning, models learn from labeled examples such as spam vs. not spam. Unsupervised learning finds structure like clusters without labels. Reinforcement learning optimizes decisions via rewards. Common pitfalls include overfitting and bias.","gold_outline":{"title":"ML Basics","topics":["Supervised","Unsupervised","Reinforcement"],"sections":[{"heading":"Intro","bullets":["Learn from data not rules"]},{"heading":"Supervised","bullets":["Labeled examples","Spam detection"]},{"heading":"Unsupervised","bullets":["Clustering","K-means"]},{"heading":"Reinforcement","bullets":["Agent, environment, reward"]},{"heading":"Pitfalls","bullets":["Overfitting","Bias"]}]}}

Proper normalization improves data integrity and reduces update anomalies.","gold_outline":{"title":"Database Normalization","topics":["1NF","2NF","3NF"],"sections":[{"heading":"Motivation","bullets":["Reduce redundancy","Improve integrity"]},{"heading":"1NF","bullets":["Atomic values","No repeating groups"]},{"heading":"2NF","bullets":["Full functional dependency on key"]},{"heading":"3NF","bullets":["No transitive dependencies"]}]}}

TCP/IP is a four-layer practical suite. Routers forward packets based on network addresses, while switches operate at the data link layer. Understanding encapsulation and addressing is key to troubleshooting.","gold_outline":{"title":"Networking Fundamentals","topics":["OSI","TCP/IP"],"sections":[{"heading":"Models","bullets":["OSI 7 layers","TCP/IP 4 layers"]},{"heading":"Devices","bullets":["Routers vs switches"]},{"heading":"Concepts","bullets":["Encapsulation","Addressing"]}]}}
