In supervised learning, models learn from labeled examples such as spam vs. not spam. Unsupervised learning finds structure like clusters without labels. Reinforcement learning optimizes decisions via rewards. Common pitfalls include overfitting and bias."}

Proper normalization improves data integrity and reduces update anomalies."}

TCP/IP is a four-layer practical suite. Routers forward packets based on network addresses, while switches operate at the data link layer. Understanding encapsulation and addressing is key to troubleshooting."}
