[00:00] Ever wondered how Google translates an entire web page to a different language in a matter of seconds?
[00:06] Or your phone gallery groups images based on their location?
[00:10] All of this is a product of deep learning.
[00:12] But, what exactly is deep learning?
[00:15] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which in turn is a subset of artificial intelligence.
[00:21] Artificial intelligence is a technique that enables a machine to mimic human behavior.
[00:26] Machine learning is a technique to achieve AI through algorithms trained with data.
[00:32] And finally, deep learning is a type of machine learning inspired by the structure of the human brain.
[00:38] In terms of deep learning, this structure is called an artificial neural network.
[00:43] Let's understand deep learning better and how it's different from machine learning.
[00:47] Say we create a machine that could differentiate between tomatoes and cherries.
[00:52] If done using machine learning, we'd have to tell the machine the features based on which the two can be differentiated.
[00:58] These features could be the size and the type of stem on them.
[01:02] With deep learning, on the other hand, the features are picked out by the neural network without human interference.
[01:08] Of course, that kind of independence comes at the cost of having a much higher volume of data to train our machine.
[01:15] Now, let's dive into the working of neural networks.
[01:19] Here, we have three students.
[01:21] Each of them write down the digit nine on a piece of paper.
[01:25] Notably, they don't all write it identically.
[01:28] The human brain can easily recognize the digits.
[01:31] But, what if a computer had to recognize them?
[01:34] That's where deep learning comes in.
[01:37] Here's a neural network trained to identify handwritten digits.
[01:41] Each number is present as an image of 28 x 28 pixels.
[01:45] Now, that amounts to a total of 784 pixels.
[01:50] Neurons, the core entity of a neural network, is where the information processing takes place.
[01:56] Each of the 784 pixels is fed to a neuron in the first layer of our neural network.
[02:02] This forms the input layer.
[02:05] On the other end, we have the output layer with each neuron representing a digit, with the hidden layers existing between them.
[02:12] The information is transferred from one layer to another over connecting channels.
[02:17] Each of these has a value attached to it, and hence is called a weighted channel.
[02:22] All neurons have a unique number associated with it, called bias.
[02:27] This bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs reaching the neuron, which is then applied to a function known as the activation function.
[02:37] The result of the activation function determines if the neuron gets activated.
[02:42] Every activated neuron passes on information to the following layers.
[02:46] This continues up till the second last layer.
[02:50] The one neuron activated in the output layer corresponds to the input digit.
[02:55] The weights and bias are continuously adjusted to produce a well-trained network.
[03:00] So, where is deep learning applied?
[03:03] In customer support, when most people converse with customer support agents, the conversation seems so real.
[03:09] They don't even realize that it's actually a bot on the other side.
[03:14] In medical care, neural networks detect cancer cells and analyze MRI images to give detailed results.
[03:21] Self-driving cars.
[03:22] What seemed like science fiction is now a reality.
[03:26] Apple, Tesla, and Nissan are only a few of the companies working on self-driving cars.
[03:32] So, deep learning has a vast scope.
[03:35] But it too faces some limitations.
[03:38] The first, as we discussed earlier, is data.
[03:41] While deep learning is the most efficient way to deal with unstructured data, a neural network requires a massive volume of data to train.
[03:49] Let's assume we always have access to the necessary amount of data.
[03:53] Processing this is not within the capability of every machine.
[03:57] And that brings us to our second limitation:
[04:00] computational power.
[04:02] Training a neural network requires graphical processing units, which have thousands of cores as compared to CPUs.
[04:10] And GPUs are, of course, more expensive.
[04:14] And finally, we come down to training time.
[04:17] Deep neural networks take hours or even months to train.
[04:21] The time increases with the amount of data and number of layers in the network.
[04:26] So, here's a short quiz for you.
[04:28] Arrange the following statements in order to describe the working of a neural network.
[04:33] A. The bias is added.
[04:36] B. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated.
[04:39] C. Specific neuron is activated.
[04:43] D. The result is fed to an activation function.

[04:52] So hurry!
[04:53] Some of the popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Deeplearning4j, Caffe, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.
[05:02] Considering the future predictions for deep learning and AI, we seem to have only scratched the surface.
[05:09] In fact, Hooray Technologies is working on a device for the blind that uses deep learning with computer vision to describe the world to the users.
[05:17] Replicating the human mind at its entirety may be not just an episode of science fiction for too long.
[05:24] The future is indeed full of surprises.
[05:27] And that is deep learning for you in short.
